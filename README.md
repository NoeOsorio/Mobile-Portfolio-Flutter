# Mobile Portfolio Flutter

This a repo that will help organize all the different side projects that I work on.

It was born because of the [#30DaysOfCode](https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/join-us-for-30daysofflutter.html) that Google is organizing.

# Projects

## Day 1 & 2

After I made a full installation from zero to my macbook, I record a video, so hope it could help someone (**It is only in Spanish**) I know I have to upload more, so you can configure all your enviroment, I am working my best.

## Day 3

On day one I found a great [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14725890-Pet-App) for a login page, so I worked on my own version.

## Day 4 & 5 

I worked on animations. I learnt how to work with Animataion widget, and how to draw with a Canvas widget. I [followed this tutorial](https://blog.codemagic.io/flutter-custom-painter/) if any interested.

# Day 6

I had trouble with Xcode, and could not start iOS simulator, but I worked after several times trying to reinstall Xcode from AppStore. However, I made a Home page with a menu to make it easy to see any mini project that I am working on. Also created some custom ListTiles for these menu (Of course with an AnimatedContainer)

# Day 7

I know Sunday is for laying in bed and watch anime, but I made some time to start the project of the next week: A pokedex!
Today I started implementing an async FutureBuilder of the https endpoint: https://pokeapi.co
Wish me luck!

# Day 8

OMG, my Pokédex is getting somewhere.

✅ Data from API
✅ Images from API
✅ Color Palettes from each Image

I know I have to work on colors, but hey, you can't tell me it is beautiful.
